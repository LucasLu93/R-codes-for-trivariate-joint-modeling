NFdat_newer.txt: This data set is associated to the article entitled "Trivariate joint modeling for clustered Data with longitudinal counts, recurrent events and a terminal event". It includes information about 459 visits from 177 individuals in 18 Lynch Syndrome families from Newfoundland.

Simulation study.R: This R script includes the generation and estimation codes for simulation studies of the trivariate joint model from the section 4: Simulation Studies of the same article.

Trivariate joint models.R: This R script includes the estimation code that replicates the proposed trivariate joint model from the section 5: Data Analysis, another trivariate joint model with the zero-inflated Poisson model for longitudinal count data from the section 6: Discussion, and another trivariate joint model with ignoring the familial correlations completely from the section 5.3.3: Model Comparison with Other Models of the same article. 

Bivariate joint model for longitudinal counts and a terminal event.R: This R script includes the estimation code that replicates the bivariate joint model for longitudinal counts and a terminal event from the section 5.3.3: Model Comparison with Other Models of the same article.

Bivariate joint model for recurrent events and a terminal event.R: This R script includes the estimation code that replicates the bivariate joint model for recurrent events and a terminal event from the section 5.3.3: Model Comparison with Other Models of the same article.
